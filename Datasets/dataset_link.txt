This implementation uses the **DRIVE (Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction)** dataset.

You can download it from Kaggle:  
üëâ [Retina DRIVE Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vutu123456/retina-drive-dataset)

After downloading, organize it in the following structure:

       |------images
       |------masks
|------test
       |------images
       |------masks
